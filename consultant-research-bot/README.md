```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

```

### Running the Application

1. Start MongoDB (if running locally):

```bash
mongod
```

2. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

3. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
